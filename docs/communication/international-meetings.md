# International Meeting

To enhance meeting efficiency, we aim to minimize mandatory meetings and prevent scheduling meetings beyond regular working hours.

The first instinct is to avoid meetings and work asynchronously. Then, we can have local meetings.

However, there are times when we need to hold international meetings with multiple participants.
In these cases, it is important to ensure that the meeting takes place under favorable conditions, particularly when there are many participants.

## International Meeting Schedule

Instead of favoring those who speak the loudest, we have a more democratic approach to scheduling international meetings. We suggest the following:

- We reserve the most precious time, 4-7pm CET from Monday to Thursday, for critical international needs.
- We establish a queue of topics and priorities, planning two weeks in advance with leaders.
- We use a Notion/GitHub page where anyone can propose topics or meetings.
- We hold a weekly top-management meeting to decide the allocation for the next two weeks.
- Exception: we should keep our public meetings regular.
- Anyone, can try using the unallocated slots, but there is a risk that they may be replaced by something else.

This system allows us to adapt to changing priorities and ensures everyone has an equal opportunity to get the best slots.

#### Example of cases:

- Currently, AtomOne is a priority and deserves at least a weekly meeting at a convenient international time. Later, it could be held bi-weekly, monthly, or on an ad-hoc basis.
- Some team members are louder, while others are more discreet and consistently get postponed.

#### Examples of international meetings include:

- Company alignment meetings such as TownHall and AMA.
- Topic brainstorm meetings like Gno Launch, AtomOne, and GOR.
- We also reserve a specific time slot for teams to have parallel meetings. For instance, the weekly GNO core team sync on Monday is an ideal time for other teams to do the same.

## Local Meetings for International Goals

To enhance international collaboration, we suggest rotating meeting times to accommodate various time zones. Here's how it would work:

- Every alternate week, one regional team (Europe, US, Asia) conducts a meeting while the other regions are off duty. The meeting is recorded, transcribed, and a summary is shared.
- The non-participating teams are required to review the content and cannot claim unawareness.
- The following week, another region follows the same process.

In summary, we would have a virtual weekly meeting that lasts only one hour per week. Sometimes we actively participate, while other times we watch and provide comments asynchronously.

It can work with different rhythms, but we must consider the viewing time as mandatory and choose the frequency based on the virtual meeting, not the local one.

This can also be effective for public events.
