## Overview

We utilize Discord to foster community interaction and collaboration among teams both within and outside of our company.

### Gno.land

At the heart of our community lies the Gno.land team, who actively engages with our members through
the [official Discord channel](https://discord.gg/S8nKUqwkPn). This channel serves as a vibrant space for community
interactions and discussions.

#### Cross-Team Communication

Our community Discord also features private channels specifically designed for seamless communication between different
teams. This enables effective collaboration and knowledge-sharing beyond the confines of our company, promoting a
thriving ecosystem of like-minded individuals.

#### Exploring Beyond

In addition to our primary Discord channel, the Gno.land team actively participates in other Discord servers to extend
our connections and reach. One notable server where you can find us is
the [Adena Wallet Discord](https://discord.gg/XzJMXXfrS9), where we engage with a broader audience and exchange insights
on various topics.
