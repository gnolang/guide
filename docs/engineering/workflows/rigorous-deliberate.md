# Rigorous & Deliberate Workflow

This guide delves into our "Rigorous & Deliberate" workflow, explicitly crafted
for projects and tasks of high complexity, where conventional timelines and
methodologies may not apply.

This workflow is reserved for challenging tasks where the end date might be
nebulous, and the journey to completion can be long and winding â€“ occasionally
spanning up to a year.

The focus here is not just on completion but on ensuring the utmost quality and
protection of such tasks.

## Principles

- **Protection & Isolation**: Tasks under this workflow may appear incompatible
  or even unfair when juxtaposed with tasks from other, faster workflows. Thus,
  it's essential to shield and isolate these tasks to prevent any
  misunderstandings or conflicts.
- **Transparency & Communication**: Given the long-term nature of these tasks,
  regular communication is paramount. Teammates should always be in the loop,
  understanding the progress, challenges, and updates. This consistent
  communication acts as a deterrent to potential conflicts or misunderstandings
  arising from the unique nature of these tasks.
- **Depth Over Speed**: Emphasize comprehensiveness. Inspect each MR deeply to
  ensure alignment with our standards.
- **Collective Ownership**: The quality of the codebase is everyone's
  responsibility. Reviewers act as gatekeepers, but all team members must
  prioritize excellence in their contributions.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Provide constructive and iterative feedback during the
  review process, allowing the original author to refine and improve their work
  based on multiple perspectives.

## Stages & Steps

1. **Goal Definition**: 
   * Identify and articulate a clear goal or objective for the project.
2. **Research & Foundation**:
   * Undertake comprehensive research.
   * Use findings to establish a robust foundation for subsequent stages.
   * Create detailed design proposals based on research and the set goal.
   * Submit the design for review to the Auditor to ensure alignment with the
     overarching goal.
3. **Initiation of Development**:
   * Post design approval, begin the development phase.
   * Open an early branch and initiate a draft PR, ensuring it's appropriately
     labeled.
4. **Continuous Updates & Communication**: 
   * Keep all stakeholders informed by consistently updating relevant documents
     or files (e.g., PR, issue, doc, .md).
   * Provide monthly updates highlighting progress since the last communication,
     forthcoming steps, and any challenges encountered.
   * Schedule regular check-ins with the Auditor.
   * This ensures the work remains aligned with the project's objectives and the
     originally set goal.
   * Engage in regular reviews or pair programming sessions.
   * Aim for monthly collaborations to share knowledge and enhance code quality.
5. **Documentation**:
   * Prioritize comprehensive documentation, especially for intricate tasks.
   * Ensure it's clear, detailed, and easily understandable.
6. **Review & Feedback**:
   * Appoint a minimum of two reviewers for detailed feedback.
   * Their insights ensure quality, functionality, and alignment with the goal.
   * Before concluding, the Auditor assesses the project for integrity,
     functionality, and congruence with the initially set goals.

## Recommendations

* **Open Dialogue**: Encourage open communication among team members. Regular
  discussions can lead to proactive problem-solving and innovation.
* **Adaptable Milestones**: While sticking to the goal is crucial, allow for
  minor adjustments to milestones based on feedback and unforeseen challenges.
- **Stay Updated**: Always work with the latest version of the main codebase to
  minimize merge conflicts.
- **Open Communication**: If you're unsure at any stage, communicate. Whether
  you're the goal owner or a reviewer, open dialogue ensures clarity and
  quality. 

## Definition of Completion

A goal is considered complete when:

- It has successfully passed through all stages.
- It has received Auditor approval after multiple reviews.
- There are no outstanding feedback points that could compromise its quality.
