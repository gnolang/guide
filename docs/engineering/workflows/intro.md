# Engineering Workflows

**Central Tenet**: **Simplicity through Automation**. Our aim: lean on CI/automation and eliminate manual rule enforcement.

**Disclaimer**: Our workflows will adapt and evolve as automation capabilities expand. Our vision is a future with fewer manual interventions and increased reliance on bot integrations.

**Guiding Philosophies**: We believe in **Flexibility** and **Polar Adaptability**, fostering processes that offer adaptability without stifling creativity.

**Workflow Principles**:
- **Composable & Adaptive**: These workflows can be combined, adjusted, or created from scratch. Theyâ€™re tools, not constraints.
- **Continuous Optimization**: We encourage constant refinement of workflows to suit changing needs.
- **Freedom to Override**: When a workflow feels restrictive, it's encouraged to bypass it and assume responsibility for the results.

## Workflows

1. **Infinito Tablero**  
   - Ideal for: Complex projects in small to medium teams seeking a continuous flow approach.

6. **Criteria-Based**  
   - Ideal for: Projects with clear, quantifiable objectives, especially when deeper project goals are less visible.

## Key Takeaways

- **Hierarchy in Projects**: Projects are streamlined with a hierarchical structure ensuring cohesion across sub-projects.
- **Uniqueness & Unity**: While each team tailors its rules, a foundational common ground is maintained to foster unity.
- **Effective Communication**: We prioritize clear, concise communication over excessive chatter.
- **Ultimate Flexibility**: Processes serve as guidelines, not strict rules. Adaptation in the best interest of the mission is always prioritized.
