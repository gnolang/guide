# Solo Voyager Workflow

This workflow is designed for those who thrive in a context of high
responsibility, high ownership, and high autonomy.

Tailored for entities—be it individual contributors or entire teams—that desire
or need to operate with greater freedom, often outside of standard routines, the
Solo Voyager is well-suited for side projects, specialized tasks, or
explorations that are clearer in domain but uncertain in direction.

A natural fit for tinkerers and those embarking on exploratory endeavors, it's
also the default mode for side projects.

## Principles

- **Proactive Engagement**: Remain connected to overarching goals, preempting needs and showcasing the journey.
- **High Accountability & Autonomy**: Entrusted with seamlessly aligning efforts with the broader objectives.
- **Preventive Action**: Actively prevent potential conflicts and discrepancies.
- **Transparent Self-Reliance**: Autonomy isn't isolation. Maintain open communication.

## Stages

1. **Task Selection & Planning**:
   * Define an objective, domain, or category.
   * Confirm alignment with broader goals, adjusting as the main project evolves.

2. **Self-driven Execution**:
   * Navigate autonomously, harmonizing choices with the primary project's direction.
   * Be receptive to feedback and spontaneous course adjustments.

3. **Consistent Reporting**:
   * Update stakeholders periodically on progress and insights.
   * Attend sync-ups for alignment and updates.

4. **Completion & Rigorous Documentation**:
   * Chronicle all findings, decisions, and outcomes.
   * Recognize that quality contributions might remain unmerged if they diverge from the collective vision.

## Note

The Solo Voyager path requires a delicate balance of independence and alignment.
Whether as an individual, a group, or during a project's detour, it's a journey
of autonomy, responsibility, and integration. 

It is advised that core team members allocate between 0 and 50% of their time in
this mode, using the remaining time to improve collaboration and efficiently
tackle the collective backlog. Balancing autonomy with collaborative endeavors
ensures a harmonious and productive project environment.
