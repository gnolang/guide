# Rapid Prototyping Workflow

This workflow fosters swift iteration, continuous feedback, and the embrace of
both success and learning from failure in projects.

## Principles

- **Fast Iterations**: Swiftly refine and adjust code.
- **Embrace Failure**: All outcomes are informative.
- **Feedback-Centric**: Regularly gather feedback for refinement.
- **Security First**: Prioritize safety in iterations.
- **Document the Journey**: Capture challenges and lessons.

## Stages

1. **Conceptualization**:
   * Define project logic and sketch flow.
   
2. **Development**:
   * Build initial version, optionally with a basic design.

3. **Testing & Feedback**:
   * Deploy in test environments and gather feedback.

4. **Iteration**:
   * Analyze feedback and refine the prototype.

5. **Documentation & Deployment**:
   * Chronicle lessons and prepare for final deployment.

## Exploration of Solutions

When faced with uncertainty, develop multiple solutions either sequentially, for
iterative refinement, or parallelly, to cultivate feedback and shared learning.
