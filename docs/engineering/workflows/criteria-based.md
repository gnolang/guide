# Criteria-Based Workflow

This workflow excels in environments demanding precise, measurable objectives
such as bug fixes, performance boosts, tool-score augmentations, or KPI-driven
assignments.

It's the perfect gateway for new contributors, whether they're
external aspirants aiming to prove their mettle or internal team members
venturing into unfamiliar project territory.

The clarity of the tasks diminishes
risks and downplays the necessity for premature feedback.

## Principles

- **Metrics First**: Initiate with unambiguous benchmarks, like unit tests.
- **Automated Transparency**: Integrate benchmarks into the CI system for accessible, automated outcomes.
- **Stepwise Enhancement**: Prioritize continuous betterment aligned with benchmarks.
- **Open Collaboration**: The definitive nature invites broad participation.

## Stages

1. **Benchmark Onboarding**:
   * Craft the metric—be it a unit test or performance indicator—and blend it into the CI system.
   * Trigger a PR that reflects the metric's starting position, typically flagged in red.

2. **Iterative Progression**:
   * Commit towards fulfilling the defined criteria with regular contributions. Each entry should steer the PR closer to a green metric standing.
   * As possible, use a progress bar (or an equivalent visual aid) within the PR's README to transparently trace advancements.

3. **Assessment & Alignment**:
   * Once the criteria are achieved, launch a review to ensure alterations resonate with the project's broader ambitions.

4. **Consolidation & Chronicle**:
   * Post validation, integrate the PR.
   * Document the journey, capturing improvements and benchmark evolutions.

## Recommendations

* **Ongoing Feedback Loop**: Consistently assess benchmark outcomes.
* **Engage & Enrich**: Encourage wide community involvement, capitalizing on the clarity of tasks.
* **Holistic Vision**: Beyond benchmarks, always account for the project's expansive implications.
