# Documentation

## General Best Practices

People read documentation in order to achieve a goal.
Whenever you write a new piece you should keep their goal in mind.

For instance, you're currently reading this document.
What is your goal?
Maybe you want to improve the documentation of your own project,
or perhaps you've been told this is an awesome document and your goal
is simply to enjoy reading a beautiful text of astonishing beauty.

On the other hand I know you're a developer, so there's no point explaining
what source code is. That would seem patronizing or a waste of time.

I also know that most of us don't speak English as a first language.
Unnecessarily complicated words or sentences are then obstacles to our communication.

Finally, I know you're a diverse group. Among the readers of this document you'll find people
from everywhere on the gender spectrum, different races, and different sensibilities.
I do not wish to alienate any of them, so I need to be careful with the words I choose.

All of these concrete examples can be boiled down to the following best practices.

### State A Clear Goal

### Define A Scope

### Keep It Simple

### Don't Alienate The Reader

### Keep Accessibility In Mind

### Arbitrary Choices And Consistency
