## What are the projects in Cosmos?

[Here](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) you have an updated list of projects built on top of Cosmos.

## Cosmos SDK

The [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissioned Proof-of-Authority (PoA) blockchains. Blockchains built with the Cosmos SDK are generally referred to as **application-specific blockchains**.

The goal of the Cosmos SDK is to allow developers to easily create custom blockchains from scratch that can natively interoperate with other blockchains. We envision the Cosmos SDK as the npm-like framework to build secure blockchain applications on top of [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft).
